				<h2>
					Introduction
				</h2>

				<p>
					This website <strong>is not my project</strong>, it is
					merely the site on which my project will be explained. The
					actual project can be found at the root of
					<a href="index.php">
						mickmaccallum.com
					</a> (specifically /index.php). Although there are many
					similarities between this page and my project, this page
					doesn't have all the features that are enabled in the
					project, but does use a 3rd party library that isn't
					included in the main project.
					<a href="http://prismjs.com">
						Prism.js
					</a> powers the syntax highlighting on this page.
				</p>

				<p>
					For my project I've chosen to create a personal portfolio.
					It is a landing page style site that will feature a
					responsive layout when completed (mostly implemented).
					It uses a fixed navigation bar that
					animates between sizes depending on the content offset of
					the web page. Clicking the links on the navigation bar
					causes the page to animate to align the selected section
					with the bottom of the navigation bar. This is all
					accomplished using jQuery which is located and documented at
					<a href="http://mickmaccallum.com/js/portfolio_project.js">
						cop1822.mickmaccallum.com/js/portfolio_project.js</a>,
						although this is the gist of the behavior.
				</p>

				<pre>
					<code class="language-javascript">
$(function() {
	/**
	*	Resize the landing page once onReady to override its default height of 
	*	600px and size it to the window's bounds.
	*/
	resizeLandingToWindowHeight();

	// Configure functionality of links in the navigation bar.
	$('.jquery_link').on('click', function(event) {
		// Remove default functionality of the link. We want to animate it.
		event.preventDefault();

		/**
		*	Use the href attribute as the target. This will allow the brower
		*	to fall back on link functionality without animations in case jQuery
		*	fails. This also removes the need to have an additional data
		*	attribute to keep track of which nav link is linked to each section.
		*/
		var target = $(this).attr('href');
		// Gets the large size of the navigation bar.
		var offset = $('header').data('largeSize');

		/** 
		*	Reset the offset size to the navigation bar's small size if
		*	the link will navigate the page to any section below the landing
		*	page. This is necessary to align with the navigation bar's smaller
		*	size at these offsets.
		*/
		if (target != '#landing') {
			offset = $('header').data('smallSize');
			collapseNavBar();
		};

		/**
		*	Animate the offset of the page to align the selected section with
		*	the bottom of the navigation bar.
		*/
		$('html, body').stop().animate({
			scrollTop: $(target).offset().top - offset
		}, 500);
	});
});
					</code>
				</pre>

				<p>
					The navigation bar is now entirely done. It features link
					highlighting depending on which section is currently in
					view and links that animate the page to their corresponding
					section. The bar is also capable of resizing down to mobile
					resolutions and rearranging itself into a drop down menu.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section data-id="about_me" id="about_me" class="content-light">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>
					About Me Section
				</h2>
				<p>
					This section features two divs side by side wrapped by a
					container which is responsible for centering them. In this
					case, the div on the left shows a graphic related to the
					section, and the right div shows relevant text. This is the
					simple yet powerful bit of CSS responsible for enabling
					this behavior.
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code class="language-css">
.centering_container {
	margin: 0 auto;
	width: auto;
	height: auto;
}
					</code>
				</pre>

				<p>
					From there, the two inner divs float left and right to allow
					the side by side behavior and their container features a
					max-width to force one inner div below the other if the page
					shrinks. This will be more advanced in the future once I set
					up the appropriate media queries to make this section fully
					responsive.

				<h2>
					Projects Section
				</h2>
				<p>
					This section doesn't contain a very wide variety of content.
					It has a centered title and subtitle using heading tags
					to convey the purpose of the section. Beyond that, it
					utilizes the 3rd party library
					<a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/">
						Slick.js
					</a> to power the carousel. The functionality of carousel
					is such that navigation dots and arrows are only shown if
					there are more screenshots available to show then are
					allowed on screen. This number varies based on the size of
					the screen and is configured as follows.
				</p>

				<pre>
					<code class="language-javascript">
$(function() {
	/**
	*	Initial configuration for Slick carousel. Still needs more fine tuning
	*	including auditing the confiurations for different layout sizes.
	*/
	$('.projects').slick({

		infinite: true,

				}
			}
		]
	});
});
					</code>
				</pre>

				<p>
					The images in the carousel will all be screenshots of
					mobile applications that I've developed, and will each
					link to either the GitHub repository at which the source
					of the application can be found, or directly
					to the App Store.

					This section is mostly finished. So far it contains a grid
					of information about repositories that I've either forked
					or modified on GitHub. On large screens, the grid is layed
					out in a 3xN pattern, but on smaller screens will scale down
					to 2xN and eventually 1xN.

					Each repository has the ability to only show the first 100
					or so characters of its description text and to add a
					show more link to load the rest of the text. This section
					only loads 6 repos by default, but contains the ability to
					load more in intervals of 3 until all repos are exhausted.

					This section contains the same centered title and subtitle

					I'm still not entirely sure if this is the exact data that
					I want to display here, but the basic display concept is
					final. There are 3 columns, each of which will display a
					type of skill as well as a list of items relevant to that
					skill, and a relative percentage to show competence
					in that area.
				</p>

				<p>
					The table itself isn't very complex, but it has a couple
					of interesting styling selections that make it look more
					like a collection of other elements and not a table.
					It is divided into 3 sections, each of which have a slight
					gap in between them, making it look like 3 different
					elements. Each of these sections has a light grey header,
					and a second section (sub header) that is either
					transparent or blue and contains to percentage of
					knowledge of the skill. Below these sub headers are lists
					of items I know relevant to the section. The CSS for this
					layout should make this more clear.

				<h2>
					Contact Section
				</h2>
				<p>
					This section contains a form that the user can fill out to
					email me directly. When the user submits the form, the
					default action of the form is prevented by a jQuery
					function at the bottom of
					<a href="http://cop1822.mickmaccallum.com/js/portfolio_project.js">
						cop1822.mickmaccallum.com/js/portfolio_project.js
					</a>. From there, AJAX is used to asynchronously post
					to mailer.php (code below) and retrieve its output. This
					allows the page to stay responsive during submission, as
					well as providing a concise mechanism for updating the UI
					on the main page to give the user feedback on whether or
					not the submission was successful without actually
					reloading the page.
				</p>

				<p>
					I plan on signifigantly expanding on this in the future.
					It already performs some basic form validation and prevents
					the user from submitting the form without entering correct
					information, but still needs to be expanded to show
					different error messages depending on the error. It also
					needs reworked to better match the stylings of the rest of
					the page and perhaps some slight layout changes.

					Video Tag

				<p>
					This section demonstrates the usage of a video element. It
					creates a single video element that is 800x450px without
					controls. The video is set to autoplay and to loop
					indefinately. The video sources are arranged by ascending
					file size to attempt to optimize for bandwith when being
					viewed on browsers that only download the first source
					that they need.

					Canvas Element

				<p>
					This section contains a demonstrating of the usage of the
					canvas element. It has a very basic canvas laid out in the
					full width of the section. By default, the content of the
					canvas is blank, but this page is utilizing Sketch.js to
					add the ability to draw directly on the canvas. You can
					choose the color to draw with by selecting it above the 
					canvas, and when done, the download link will allow you to
					save a png rendering of the canvas.
